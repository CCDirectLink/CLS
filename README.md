# CLS
Cross-Compatible Loader Standards - A collection of standards to make mods compatible with all loaders.

## Proposals 
This folder contains standards which haven't been implemented yet, and are thus still subject to flux.

Modifications can be performed by PR reasonably arbitrarily subject to some debate. This should be considered the "good idea" bucket.

## Standards
This folder contains standards which are *implemented*.

These matter for compatibility, so technical modifications to them can and should be subject to discussion.

PRs can and should be made before code is complete, as technical debates may ensure that require the code to be changed.

However, the acceptance of a PR must only occur *after* code is already in the respective target repositories to implement the PR.
